/*
* {
    font-family: 'Raleway' !important;
    }
    
    I tried to do this in external css but it still did not override the styles, instead for more holistic styles I will be using internal css
    and external css to target very specific classes in the HTML code*/
  
    /*
    .nav-link {
        color: black;
    }
    
    This still isn't working when I use specific classes */
